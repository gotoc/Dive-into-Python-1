Dive into Python - an IPython notebook

I'm working through the awesomely useful Dive into Python <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/" title="Title">www.diveintopython.net/</a> and have also just discoverd the IPython notebook <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html" title="Title">ipython.org/notebook.html</a>, so it's 1+1=python learning fun!

Thanks to Mark Pilgrim for the initial creation of Dive into Python, Josh Gachnag for keeping it going, the IPython community and Enthought for Canopy <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/" title="Title">www.enthought.com/products/canopy/</a> which makes running scientific Python so easy on OS X.
